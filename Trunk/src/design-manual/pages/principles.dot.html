						<h2>UX Principles</h2>
						<p>ICAEW’s 10 UX principles echo a culture of designing experiences for our users, not for the organisation. They offer a framework to evaluate our work and inform everyone how we deliver useful, elegant and simple-to-use interfaces.</p>

						<h3>Users want</h3>
						<p>Designing for users is at the centre of everything we do.</p>
						<div class="callout component">
						  <h5>Why?</h5>
						  <p>Understanding our users, their goals, behaviours and frustrations and shaping solutions using this insight improves engagement, satisfaction and retention.</p>
						</div>

						<h3>Discoverable content</h3>
						<p>We deliver systems that find, sort and present information so the right content is found at the first time of asking.</p>
						<div class="callout component">
							<h5>Why?</h5>
							<p><strong>64%</strong> of users start their journey to ICAEW on a search engine</p>
							<p><strong>92%</strong> of these search journeys use Google</p>
							<p>Users don’t want to put effort into finding content through menus</p>
						</div>

						<h3>Personal experiences</h3>
						<p>As humans we will speak to our users as individuals with an understanding of their context and their intentions.</p>
						<div class="callout component">
							<h5>Why?</h5>
							<p>Everyone is different</p>
							<p>By using data we hold on an individual we can make experiences both enjoyable and rewarding</p>
						</div>


						<h3>In real-time</h3>
						<p>Align data-points so that we deliver content and information immediately.</p>
						<div class="callout component">
							<h5>Why?</h5>
							<p>Humans have uncertainty and insecurities – they deserve feedback and assurance straight away</p>
							<p>Technological advancement increasingly means expectations of such immediacy are set by our competitors and big brands</p>
							<p>Members and students are being passed to call centre operators before the system loads queries, frustrating the caller and the agent and starting the call off on a poor footing</p>
						</div>



						<h3>On any device</h3>
						<p>We design solutions to work on any device, at any time.</p>
						<div class="callout component">
							<h5>Why?</h5>
							<p>In 2017 <strong>33%</strong> of all sessions on icaew.com were accessed through a mobile or tablet. A <strong>79%</strong> increase on 2016 our members and students demonstrate comfort with all devices.</p>
							<p>They read emails on the phone in the morning, work on the laptop in the office, check the news on the phone during the train journey home and reads a book on the tablet in the evening.</p>
						</div>



						<h3>Using any technology</h3>
						<p>Although future-proofing isn’t possible, we’ll define open solutions that offer flexibility in the long term.</p>
						<div class="callout component">
							<h5>Why?</h5>
							<p>It provides the opportunity to explore and test emerging or alternative or technologies.</p>
							<p>The freedom to experiment enables us to react to changing market conditions</p>
						</div>



						<h3>Across boundaries</h3>
						<p>As far as it’s in our control a user in Singapore with the same needs as a user in London will be able to access the same content, seek the same information and complete the same tasks as a user in London.</p>
						<div class="callout component">
							<h5>Why?</h5>
							<p>We aspire to be a fully international organisation and don’t discriminate against individuals for being based outside the UK ICAEW’s <strong>149,000</strong> members are spread across <strong>154</strong> countries</p>
							<p>In 2017 <strong>42%</strong> of sessions on icaew.com came from outside the UK</p>
						</div>



						<h3>Quickly</h3>
						<p>The target average page download duration is three seconds.</p>
						<div class="callout component">
							<h5>Why?</h5>
							<p>The fast our digital services perform, the fewer users will abandon and go on to achieve their goal.</p>
							<p>Various studies have found that 40% of users abandon a page if it takes <strong>>3s</strong> to load</p>
							<p>Three seconds was recommended to ICAEW as part of a 2016 consultation with NCC after competitor benchmarking Google include site speed as a ranking factor</p>
						</div>



						<h3>On solutions that are tested</h3>
						<p>We validate our solutions with users right throughout the design process, placing emphasis on what they do, not what they say.</p>
						<div class="callout component">
							<h5>Why?</h5>
							<p>So that we can iterate whilst we design</p>
							<p>If it doesn’t work with users we ‘fail fast’ </p>
							<p>We release solutions sooner, with a greater chance of success</p>
						</div>


						<h3>For humans</h3>
						<p>Keep designs simple, straightforward and accessible. We follow conventions and avoid deviating from the norm unless it adds to the value of the experience.</p>
						<div class="callout component">
							<h5>Why?</h5>
							<p>Everyone is different (again)</p>
							<p>Inconsistency leads to hesitation and uncertainty</p>
							<p>Designing for the few often adds complexity </p>
						</div>

						<h2>Design Principles</h2>
						<p>Craft rewarding visual experiences to deliver engaging information that satisfy our member’s needs, throughout the lifecycle of their career.</p>
						<div class="callout component">
							<h5>Our rules of play</h5>
							<ol>
								<li>Does the design embody our brand and ethos?</li>
								<li>Is the design unified and consistent?</li>
								<li>Is the design transparent and intuitive?</li>
								<li>Is the design innovative and inspiring?</li>
								<li>Does the design seek to engage and delight?</li>
								<li>Is the design consumable and digestible?</li>
								<li>Is the design organic and progressive?</li>
